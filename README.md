This is a Rust crate created to do calculations on matroid, and especially calculation of combinatorial derived matroids, see [this paper](https://doi.org/10.37236/11327).

There are some examples of the usage in the `examples` directory.

## Precalculated combinatorial derived matroid

In the `calculated_matroids` directory, there are a precalculated combinatorial derived matroid.
This can be loaded, an example of this is the `vamos_derived.rs` example.
